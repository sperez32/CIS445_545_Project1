     <h2 class="spacing">Values and Beliefs</h2>
     <p class="spaceParagraph"> As an individual, I value my everyday interactions with others as well as my time
        that I spend alone. Other key values of mine are persistence, determination, and dedication especially when it comes to anything that I do.
        I am a firm believer in completing tasks, no matter the complexity of the task, correctly and always open to 
        learning and expanding my knowledge.
     </p>

     <h2 class="spacing">Career Aspirations</h2>
     <p class="spaceParagraph"> My career aspirations has changed numerous times since high school. Currently, I aspire to have a position in the Cybersecurity 
        industry but more specifically an ethical hacker. However, I am still keeping my options open and would like get experience in as many
        different positions I possibly can.
     </p>

     <h2 class="spacing">Interest and Hobbies</h2>
     <p class="spaceParagraph"> When it comes to my freetime, I absolutely love staying active and playing sports. Going to the gym everyday is something I am 
        very fond of. I still am playing baseball for the Club Baseball team at Bradley University and have been playing baseball for 18 consecutive years. Back in high
        school, I also picked up a passion for golfing which I often do during my freetime if the weather permits it. 

        Other than staying active, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I also enjoy listening to music and playing video games.
